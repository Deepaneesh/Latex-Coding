## Creating Article in LAtex
Creating an article in LaTeX involves defining the document structure and content through a series of commands. First, you specify the document class using `\documentclass{article}`, which sets the document type as an article. Then, in the preamble (before `\begin{document}`), you can include various packages to enhance functionality, such as `\usepackage{amsmath}` for mathematical formatting or `\usepackage{graphicx}` for including images. After the preamble, you begin the content of the article within the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` environment. You can add a title with `\title{}`, author with `\author{}`, and date with `\date{}`, followed by `\maketitle` to generate the title block. The document is then structured with sections using `\section{}` and `\subsection{}` to organize content. LaTeX also allows easy formatting of text, inclusion of mathematical equations, and tables. Once the document is complete, it can be compiled into a PDF using a LaTeX editor.
