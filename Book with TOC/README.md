## TABLE OF CONTENT
In LaTeX, creating a book with a Table of Contents (TOC) is straightforward. You use the `book` document class, which automatically supports chapters, sections, and subsections. The Table of Contents can be generated using the `\tableofcontents` command, placed where you want the TOC to appear in your document (usually after the title page or introduction). LaTeX will automatically update the TOC with entries for all chapters, sections, and subsections as you define them using commands like `\chapter{}`, `\section{}`, and `\subsection{}`.

Each time you compile the LaTeX document, LaTeX will update the TOC to reflect the content structure, including page numbers. If your document is large and has multiple parts, LaTeX will also handle page breaks appropriately between chapters and sections. This makes the process of organizing and formatting a book, including generating a TOC, efficient and automated.
