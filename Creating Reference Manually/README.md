# Creating Reference Manually

Creating references manually in LaTeX involves directly entering the citation details within the document rather than relying on a separate bibliography file. You can manually list references using the `thebibliography` environment. Within this environment, each reference is added with the `\bibitem{}` command, where the citation key is provided in curly braces. The details of each reference, such as authors, titles, and publication years, are written after the `\bibitem{}` command. To cite a reference in the text, you use the `\cite{}` command with the corresponding citation key. This method gives you full control over the formatting of the references but requires manual entry and updating of the reference list. The `thebibliography` environment automatically numbers the references in the order they are cited within the document.
